# Stereotype `«MavenProject»`
The stereotype `«MavenProject»` can be used to add Maven-specific information to an artifact. Based on the provided information, JEAF Generator will then be able to generate Maven project structures from the UML model.

| **Stereotype**          | `«MavenProject»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Artifact`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `archetype`   | `ProjectArchetype` | JEAF Generator supports several project archetypes. The archetype defines the general structure of a Maven project and, in particular, all the modules that a project will contain. |
| `serviceTypes`   | `ServiceType` | If a Maven project uses the archetype `SERVICE_MODEL`, this tag can be used to define which types of services should be supported.<br><br>By default, both synchronous and reactive services are supported. |
| `groupId`   | `String` | Group ID of the Maven artifact. If no value is defined here, a group ID will be derived based on the configured naming pattern.<br><br>By default, the fully qualified package name will be used. |
| `artifactId`   | `String` | Artifact ID of the Maven artifact. If no value is defined here, an artifact ID will be derived based on the configured naming pattern.<br><br>By default, the name of the artifact’s UML element will be used. The element’s name will be converted to lower case, and all spaces will be replaced with “-” to comply with Maven naming conventions. |
| `projectURL`   | `String` | This tag can be used to specify a project URL, as defined in a Maven POM.<br><br>If no value is provided here, the configured pattern for project URLs will be used. By default, no project URL will be set. |
| `scmType`   | `SCMType` | This tag can be used to specify the SCM type that is used.<br><br>By default, `GIT` will be used. |
| `scmPath`   | `String` | This tag can be used to define the SCM path, as supported in a Maven POM. If no value is specified here, the configured SCM path pattern will be used.<br><br>By default, no SCM path will be defined in the generated POM file.. |
| `customizable`   | `Boolean` | This tag specifies whether the generated POMs for this artifact should be customizable.<br><br>If the tag is set to `true`, the generated POM files will include several so-called protected regions where customizations can be made. Since the generated POM files work out of the box in almost all cases, it is recommended to enable this option only when truly necessary. |
| `customArchetypeName`   | `String` |  |
| `modelCoordinatesSource`   | `UMLCoordinatesSourceType` | Tag defines from where coordinates for UML model lookup are taken.<br><br>The following options are available:<br>* `USE_FROM_PARENT_POM`: Use UML model coordinates from parent POM<br>* `USE_OWN`: UML model coordinates should be defined within this Maven project<br>* `USE_PARENT_OR_OWN`: Use coordinates from parent POM if applicable. If not then they should be defined within this Maven project.<br>* `NONE`: Within this Maven project no UML model coordinates should be defined.<br>* `USE_DEFAULT`: Use default settings as defined in configuration of JEAF Generator Maven Plugin. |
